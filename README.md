# sound2shape_crossmodal
This repository contains the source code and audio stimuli for an interactive web-based experiment exploring cross-modal correspondences between sound and visual shape. Participants adjust a morphing shape via a slider to reflect the texture of various audio stimuli, ranging from smooth to rough to sharp.
