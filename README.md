# ðŸŽ§ðŸ”µ Soundâ€“Shape Crossmodal Correspondence Experiment

This repository contains the full implementation and audio material for an interactive web-based experiment exploring how people intuitively associate **sound textures** with **visual shape morphologies**.  

Participants listen to short sound clips and adjust a shape via a sliderâ€”from smooth to rough to sharpâ€”based on how they perceive each sound.
